                <td><h4>Written with sympathetic humor and compassion, this masterful portrait of upper-class decline made Ivan Goncharov famous throughout Russia on its publication in 1859. Ilya Ilyich Oblomov is a member of Russia’s dying aristocracy—a man so lazy that he has given up his job in the Civil Service, neglected his books, insulted his friends, and found himself in debt. Too apathetic to do anything about his problems, he lives in a grubby, crumbling apartment, waited on by Zakhar, his equally idle servant. Terrified by the activity necessary to participate in the real world, Oblomov manages to avoid work, postpones change, and—finally—risks losing the love of his life. This superb translation by David Magarshack captures all the subtle comedy and near-tragedy of the original.</h4></td>

                    Often criticized and all-too-rarely understood, the philosophy of Jean-Paul Sartre encompasses the dilemmas and aspirations of the individual in contemporary society. "Being and Nothingness "contains all the basic tenets of his thought, as well as all its more intricate details. A work of inherent force and epic scope, it provides a vivid analysis for all who would understand one of the most influential philosophic movements of any age, and makes clear why "The New York Times "hailed Sartre's masterpiece as "a philosophy to be reckoned with, both for its own intrinsic power and as a profound symptom of our time."</h4></td>
